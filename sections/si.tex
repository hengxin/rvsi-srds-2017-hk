  Snapshot isolation requires that:

    \item[Snapshot Read:] Each transaction read data from the ``lastest'' snapshot as of the time the transaction started.
    \item[Snapshot Write:] No \red{write}-conflicting concurrent transactions

  \begin{description}[Snapshot Write:]
    \item[Snapshot Read:] All reads of transaction $T_i$ occur at $T_i$'s start time.
